Stats Module
------------

The Stats module defines the Stat entity type. Stat entities are used
to represent statistics about other entities. Each stat consists of a
name, a subject reference, and a set of values, where each value has a
value, a date, and a source reference.

Stats are closely related to field values. The difference is that stats
are values that tied to specific points in time. Each stat represents
a time series of values.
